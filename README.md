GAM-R will be a one-stop dashboard for gamers where they can find everything they need to know about the newest games including up-to-date news, game bios, and live streaming from a game's top players on Tewitch. Currently, gamers have to navigate between two or more websites and apps to explore new games and discover any meaningful information. GAM-R consolidates all of this into a single user-friendly and sharp interface.
